Bookshelf API is a simple RESTful API for managing a collection of books. This project was created as part of the **"Belajar Back-End Pemula dengan JavaScript"** course from Dicoding.

**Important Note**: 
While this project is a great starting point, remember that simply copying the work is not enough. Itâ€™s crucial to take the time to understand each piece of code, how it works, and why it is structured this way. This will help you build a solid foundation for your skills in backend development. **Learning is about understanding the logic, not just repeating the code.**

## Features
- Add a new book.
- View all books in the collection.
- Retrieve details of a specific book by its ID.
- Update an existing book's details by its ID.
- Delete a book from the collection by its ID.

## Technology Stack
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment.
- **Hapi.js**: Framework for building the server.
- **NanoID**: For generating unique IDs for books.

## Testing
You can test the API using the provided Postman collection and environment files available in the /api folder. Make sure to import them into Postman to easily test all the endpoints.
